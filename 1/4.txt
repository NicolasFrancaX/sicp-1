;; SICP Exercise 1.4
;;
;; Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions.
;; Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:
;;
;; (define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
;;  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

The procedure read two numbers a and b, if b is greater than 0 it sum a and b, else it subtract a and b,
returning in both cases a + |b|. Ex:

(a-plus-abs-b 1  2) = (+ 1  2) = 3
(a-plus-abs-b 1 -2) = (- 1 -2) = 3

;; SICP Exercise 1.4
;;
;; Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions.
;; Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:
;;
;; (define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
;;  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

The procedure read two numbers a and b and performs an operation depending of the value of b. If b is greater than 0 it performs a sum between a and b, else it performs a subtract between a and b returning in bot cases a + |b|. Example:

(a-plus-abs-b 1  2) = (+ 1  2) = 3
(a-plus-abs-b 1 -2) = (- 1 -2) = 3
